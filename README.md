# CS.120-Final-Project-The-Green-Glass-Door
Final Project for CS.120 Course at Ball State University 

The goal of this project is to show what I've learned this semester and create something of my own. 

The Green Glass Door is a word puzzle game where one player tries to figure out the “key” to the Green Glass Door. They guess words they think might fit the key and go through the door, and someone who knows the key responds with whether it does or not. 

The player will type guesses into a text box. Each guess will add 1 to its respective score label (correct/incorrect). To win, they must type 10 words in a row that fit through the door.

This project uses SimpleGE, a basic pygame game engine created by Andy Harris.

I learned a lot during this project. The biggest thing is the way that simple ideas and projects can take way longer than expected to program. I thought it would be a breeze getting this idea to work and look good, but there were a lot of struggles. I am glad I didn't wait until I thought I needed to start the project, or else I wouldn't have been able to complete it. I also learned that I actually really love programming, and I am considering majoring in Computer Science. I wish I had put more effort into this game and previous projects, but I am now excited to do that in CS121.

I got stuck on a lot of things - figuring out how to check for double letters, finding images I liked that were free to use, formatting the game to make it look nice, trying to get rid of the empty black box that appeared every time I hit enter in the text box, and working out some scene flow issues.

I would like to improve my efficiency. I could have got a lot of things done quicker had I stopped and set clear goals for each session. Many times I got sidetracked on one small issue and lost sight of what was important. I also would like to improve my overall understanding of what I'm doing. I have a basic understanding, enough to get by, but I want to get a deeper idea of what's going on. 

Next time I would set better milestones, have a more consistent work schedule, and try to absorb more information throughout the semester. I also just realized that I haven't been saving to github after each milestone...

I didn't stray away from the game design document at all.

I stayed mostly on track by trying to do a little bit every day, but as I explained above, I need to improve on that process.
